# slot-machine

I just got back from Vegas and was feeling inspired by the city of slots.


I made this project in vanilla JS, CSS, and HTML as a kind of refresher. I was able to do most of the coding on the plane, devoid of wifi, and I had just the idea and the code to make it happen.


The game is simple: you will get a small win if you have two of a kind on the board, a slightly bigger win if the two are connected, and some variation of a jackpot if you hit three in a row.
